<PRE><A HREF=:>

There is no web page for this course, but rather, a Unix
directory structure.  The proper way to access it is by using
ssh to log into a Cats IC Solaris host.  However, if you
actually do like that silly pointy clicky method of accessing
information, the local web server will format the Unix
directories as web pages for you.

If you are looking in this directory properly, i.e., via Unix
commands, there is nothing of interest here.  Just ``cd ..''.
If you are a pointy clicky type, click on the colon above or
right here on this README to get to the course directory.  And
don't call it a folder.  The web link labelled Parent Directory
above is not actually the parent directory but a link to a Cats
web directory.

If you are using a web client on a ucsc.edu host, you should see
no password request.  From off campus, you need to enter a
username, but may leave the password field blank.  To discover
the username, log into a Cats IC host and look at the hidden
file ``.htpasswd'' in the parent of this directory.
